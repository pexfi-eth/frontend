## 1. Overview & Vision

Today’s crypto trading happens on centralized exchanges (CEXes). These platforms act like traditional banks — freezing accounts, demanding sensitive documents, blocking users by country, and enforcing heavy regulations. They control who can access crypto and when, and how — turning what should be a borderless tool into a gated system.

**PEXFI exists to fix that.**

It’s a decentralized, peer-to-peer crypto-to-fiat marketplace where users trade directly with each other. No company holds your funds, no KYC is required, and smart contract escrows protect every trade. You stay in control of your keys and your privacy.

PEXFI brings crypto back to its original purpose — open, censorship-resistant, and truly peer-to-peer.

## 2. Market Research

The peer‑to‑peer crypto trading market shows strong demand, especially in regions with limited banking access or high remittance needs. Legacy and custodial platforms have captured this demand but carry significant downsides.

### Legacy & Centralized Competitors

- **LocalBitcoins**  
  Custodial with strict KYC. Shut down in 2023 under regulatory pressure.  
  *Peak Volume:* ~$2 B/year *Revenue:* ~$25 M/year  

- **Paxful**  
  Global reach but custodial escrow. Suspended operations in 2023 due to compliance challenges.  
  *Volume:* ~$1.6 B/year *Revenue:* ~$15–20 M/year  

- **Remitano**  
  Southeast Asia & Africa focus. Custodial dispute resolution.  
  *Volume (2018):* ~$3 B/year *Revenue:* Undisclosed  

- **Noones**  
  Custodial P2P platform. Suffered a $7.9 M hack in 2025 via Solana‑bridge exploit.  
  *Takeaway:* Partial decentralization can still be exploited.  

- **RoboSats**  
  Bitcoin/Lightning P2P via Tor. No KYC.  
  *Weaknesses:* Bitcoin‑only, technical UX hurdle, no fiat dispute mediation.  

- **Bisq**  
  Desktop‑only, multichain P2P. Uses bonded arbitrators.  
  *Weaknesses:* Complex UX, slow trades, limited fiat options.  

### Opportunity for PEXFI

Legacy platforms either shut down, impose KYC, or suffer hacks. PEXFI’s fully non‑custodial, open‑source, no‑KYC model fills the gap for censorship‑resistant, privacy‑focused fiat ramps.

---

## 3. Core Philosophy

- **Non‑Custodial**: No one holds your funds except you. Escrows are smart contracts.  
- **Censorship‑Resistant**: Entirely on‑chain, no central server to shut down or force to comply with regulations.  
- **Privacy‑First**: No KYC. No data collection. Users interact via wallet addresses only.
- **Open‑Source**: All code verifiable on‑chain and via public repos.  

---

## 4. Key Features

- **Escrow Smart Contract**  
  Open‑source escrow that locks crypto until both sides confirm. Arbitrators can only approve or revert — never withdraw funds.

- **Reputation NFT**  
  Free, non‑transferable NFT per wallet tracks trade volume, completion rate, and disputes, helping peers assess trustworthiness.

- **KYC‑Free Trading**  
  Connect your wallet, agree on payment, and trade — no identity checks required.

- **IPFS Frontend**  
  Decentralized hosting for complete censorship resistance.

- **Custom Trading Interfaces**  
  Traders can build or use any frontend—browser apps, mobile UIs, or scripts—to post and manage offers. Every trade, regardless of the interface, is protected by PEXFI’s escrow contracts and covered by the same dispute resolution process.
  
### Incentives & Rewards

- **Fee Refunds for Reviews**  
  After a successful trade, users who leave feedback receive a partial refund of their trading fee, encouraging transparency and accountability.

- **Badges for Participation**  
  Users can earn or buy NFT badges that are displayed on their profiles and impact search ranking in the marketplace catalog.

## 5. Tokenomics

### Initial Supply

- **Total Supply:** 100,000,000 PEXFI (fixed)

### Distribution

- **Liquidity Pools:** 50%  
  Used to create initial and future decentralized exchange (DEX) pools for trading.

- **Reserve:** 20%  
  Held for future development, ecosystem growth, and unexpected opportunities. Locked for 12 months.

- **Team:** 15%  
  Vesting over 24 months with a 6-month cliff to align long-term incentives.

- **Pre-sale:** 10%  
  Small private pre-sale intended to seed the first liquidity pool and bootstrap community. Locked at listing price.

- **Airdrops & Incentives:** 5%  
  Distributed to early users and contributors to incentivize adoption.

### Fee Model

- **PEXFI Fee Discount**  
  Pay **0.25% per side** (maker/taker) when using PEXFI — a 50% discount from the standard 0.5% fee.  

- **Automatic Conversion**  
  If fees are paid in other tokens, the platform swaps them into PEXFI on a DEX, creating **consistent buy pressure**.

- **Fee Destination**  
  100% of fees (paid or converted) flow into the **Treasury** contract in PEXFI.

### Treasury

The Treasury accumulates PEXFI fees and allocates them for:

- **StakerRewards (50%)** — for arbitration/staking payouts  
- **ProtocolFund (40%)** — development, marketing, integrations  
- **OperationsFund (10%)** — audits, support, infrastructure  

### Utility

- **Trade Fee Discount**  
  Save on every trade using PEXFI.  
- **NFT Badges**  
  Earn or purchase badge NFTs for your profile. Badges influence your ranking and visibility in trade catalogs, rewarding engagement and trust.
  
- **Market Demand**  
  Fee conversion drives token buy pressure as volume grows.

- **Speculation**  
  Fixed supply, deflationary slashing burns, and growing utility attract holders.

## 6. Security & Trust Model

- **Open Source & Auditable**  
  All smart contracts and frontend are publicly verifiable.

- **Non‑Custodial**  
  Users hold their own funds at all times.

- **Dispute Resolution**  
  A fair process is in place to help resolve stuck or problematic trades.

- **Privacy by Design**

### Launch Strategy

#### Whitelist Presale Model
- Private, invite-based presale to whitelist addresses.
- A small raise is planned.
- **50% of presale funds** will be used to bootstrap the initial liquidity pool (PEXFI/ETH) on Uniswap.
- PEXFI is initially paired with USDC to provide stable price discovery.
- Early buyers benefit from upward price movement as platform volume creates organic token demand.

#### Benefits
- Prevents sniping bots from draining the pool.
- Allows controlled price discovery.
- Rewards early backers with fair entry prices.

## 9. Fraud Mitigation

1. **Payment Fraud**  
   - *Vector*: Fake or reversible payments.  
   - *Mitigation*: Encourage irreversible methods; arbitrator evidence review; reputation filtering.

2. **Seller Non‑Release**  
   - *Vector*: Seller holds crypto after fiat.  
   - *Mitigation*: On‑chain escrow; arbitrator enforcement.

3. **Arbitrator Collusion**  
   - *Vector*: Bribery or bias.  
   - *Mitigation*: Manual vetting (initial), future DAO slashing; multi‑arbitrator consensus.

4. **Identity Impersonation**  
   - *Vector*: Off‑platform scams.  
   - *Mitigation*: Wallet‑only trades; in‑app messaging only; on‑chain reputation NFTs.

5. **Front‑Running**  
   - *Vector*: Observing & re‑submitting orders.  
   - *Mitigation*: Optional commit‑reveal; hidden offer details.

6. **Spam/DoS**  
   - *Vector*: Fake trades, message floods.  
   - *Mitigation*: Small refundable fee to post; rate limits; reputation gating.

7. **Sybil Attacks**  
   - *Vector*: Multiple wallets farming airdrops/reputation.  
   - *Mitigation*: Volume‑based and time‑weighted reputation; graph‑analysis detection.

## 10. Legal & Compliance

PEXFI is designed as open-source, non-custodial software enabling peer-to-peer value exchange. It does not act as a broker, exchange, custodian, or financial intermediary.

### Key Legal Principles

- **Software, Not a Service**  
  PEXFI provides decentralized smart contracts that users interact with directly. There is no central operator or hosted service acting as an intermediary.

- **User Responsibility**  
  Users are fully responsible for complying with local laws, including regulations around money transmission, taxation, and fiat payments. PEXFI collects no user data and cannot monitor usage.

- **No Custody or Intermediation**  
  At no point does PEXFI or its developer(s) hold user funds. All trades are locked and released through permissionless smart contracts with user signatures and/or arbitrator votes.

- **No KYC, No Data Retention**  
  PEXFI never collects or stores personal data, removing liability and attack vectors associated with sensitive information.

- **DAO Transition Considerations**  
  As governance decentralizes, the DAO may choose to publish jurisdictional guidelines, disclaimers, or risk disclosures tailored to each region, but the core platform remains non-custodial code.

### Compliance Strategy

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Developers, wallets, and community contributors are free to build tools or interfaces that align with local regulations — without affecting the neutrality of the protocol.

- **No Fiat Handling**  
  Fiat payment arrangements occur entirely off-chain between peers, outside the scope of the protocol. The platform does not facilitate, process, or custody fiat.

- **Legal Jurisdiction**  
  The project maintains no corporate entity at this time. If one is formed (e.g., for grants or coordination), it will be based in a jurisdiction with favorable treatment of open-source and DAO-governed protocols.
